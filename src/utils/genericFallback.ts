REQUIREMENTS:
- 3 to 4 players (support min 2, max 6)
- Each player gets 7 cards initially
- Central sequence pile where players play cards relative to previous (match suit OR be exactly 1 rank higher or lower)
- Always include actions: play, draw, pass
- Win condition: First to empty their hand
- Add one special rule using a specific rank (like 8s are wild to change suit OR 7 reverses turn order) â€” pick one, not both.
- Provide tableLayout.type = "sequence" with a starting card so gameplay begins
- Ensure deadlock prevention: if a player cannot play they draw exactly 1 card, then may pass
- Keep overall description concise and clear.
