# Firebase + Vercel Deployment Setup Guide

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Updated Firebase Rules (Write-Only)
- Changed from `allow read, write: if true` to `allow create: if true`
- Now only allows creating new emails, not reading them
- Better security for public access

### 2. Created Vercel API Functions
- `/api/newsletter.js` - Handles email signups via Firebase Admin SDK
- `/api/admin/login.js` - Admin authentication with JWT
- `/api/admin/stats.js` - Protected admin stats from Firebase

### 3. Added Required Dependencies
- `firebase-admin` - Server-side Firebase operations
- `jsonwebtoken` - Admin session management
- `@types/jsonwebtoken` - TypeScript support

## Why Your Emails Weren't Saving

Your setup had these issues:
1. **Backend used local files** instead of Firebase (doesn't work on Vercel)
2. **Frontend expected `/api` routes** but you had Express server on port 3001
3. **No Firebase Admin SDK** integration in backend
4. **Vercel deploys are stateless** - local file storage doesn't persist

## Environment Variables You Need to Set

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add these variables:

```bash
# Firebase Admin SDK (from Firebase Console â†’ Service Account)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your-private-key-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-private-key-here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secure-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-for-sessions

# OpenAI (if using)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### Getting Firebase Service Account:
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings
2. Service Accounts tab
3. Click "Generate new private key"
4. Download the JSON file
5. Extract the values for your environment variables

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Firebase Rules
Copy the updated rules from `firebase-rules.txt` to your Firebase Console:
- Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules
- Paste the new rules and publish

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# If not already deployed to Vercel
npx vercel

# If already deployed, redeploy
npx vercel --prod
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add all the environment variables listed above.

### 4. Test the Setup
1. Visit your deployed site
2. Try signing up with an email
3. Check Firebase Console â†’ Firestore to see if emails appear
4. Test admin dashboard login

## Local Development

Your app should now work both locally and in production:

### Local (uses server/index.js):
```bash
npm run dev  # Frontend on localhost:5173
# Separate terminal:
cd server && npm start  # Backend on localhost:3001
```

### Production (uses Vercel API functions):
- Frontend served by Vercel
- API calls go to `/api/*` routes (our new Vercel functions)
- Firebase Admin SDK handles database operations

## Testing Your Fix

1. **Local Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Try signing up - should save to Firebase

2. **Production Test:**
   Deploy to Vercel and try the signup form

3. **Admin Test:**
   Visit `/admin` and try logging in with your admin password

## Security Notes

- âœ… Firebase rules now write-only for public
- âœ… Admin routes protected with JWT
- âœ… Sensitive operations server-side only
- âœ… Environment variables secured in Vercel

Your emails should now save properly to Firebase! ðŸŽ‰
