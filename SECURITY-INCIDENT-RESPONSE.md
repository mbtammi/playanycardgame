# 🚨 EMERGENCY: API KEYS WERE COMPROMISED - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED!

## **⚠️ SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE**

This document outlines the API keys that were accidentally exposed during development and need immediate revocation.

---

## **🔥 COMPROMISED CREDENTIALS - REVOKE IMMEDIATELY:**

### 1. **OpenAI API Keys**
**Pattern:** `sk-proj-*` (keys starting with sk-proj-EWCPKQMZvqRw)
- **Action:** [OpenAI API Keys Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Steps:** Delete old key → Create new key → Update server/.env

### 2. **Stripe API Keys**  
**Pattern:** `sk_test_51RClR4*` and `pk_test_51RClR4*`
- **Action:** [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
- **Steps:** Roll/delete both keys → Generate new test keys

### 3. **Replicate Token**
**Pattern:** `r8_*` (tokens starting with r8_azN94n7L0f5gkMD1mM)
- **Action:** [Replicate Account Settings](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
- **Steps:** Delete token → Create new token

### 4. **Firebase API Keys**
**Pattern:** `AIzaSy*` (multiple keys from different projects)
- **Projects:** `playanycardgame-f5d09` and `engine-f5597`
- **Action:** [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- **Steps:** Delete compromised keys → Create restricted keys

### 5. **Admin Password**
**Pattern:** Passwords starting with `Ssecnu*`
- **Action:** Generate new strong password → Update server/.env

## **✅ SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

- ✅ **Removed all VITE_ environment variables** containing sensitive data
- ✅ **Implemented secure backend API** with JWT authentication
- ✅ **Protected admin endpoints** with proper authorization
- ✅ **Email data no longer exposed** to frontend
- ✅ **File-based storage** as fallback (no database exposure)
- ✅ **Proper separation** between frontend and backend

---

## **🛡️ PREVENTION MEASURES:**

❌ **Never Again:**
- Put API keys in `VITE_` environment variables
- Commit `.env` files to git
- Share credentials in messages/streams
- Use same keys across multiple projects

✅ **Always Do:**
- Use server-side APIs for sensitive operations
- Keep environment variables on server only
- Use different keys for dev/production
- Regularly rotate API keys

## **📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] OpenAI - Old key revoked, new key generated
- [ ] Stripe - Both keys rolled, new keys generated  
- [ ] Replicate - Old token deleted, new token created
- [ ] Firebase - Compromised keys deleted, new restricted keys created
- [ ] Admin - Strong new password set
- [ ] Server .env - Updated with all new credentials
- [ ] Frontend - No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Application - Tested end-to-end
